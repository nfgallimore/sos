Hi Nick,
My name is Ruby Rodriguez, Chief Human Resources Officer for Students of Strength.  Here at Students of Strength we empower students in need with the tools they need to succeed, and we do this in two ways.
 Firstly, we have developed a robust and expansive curriculum for grades 6-12 - Language Arts and Social Studies, STEM, College Advising and Test Prep, and Social Skills/Character Building. The innovative character building course teaches students how to develop the soft skills necessary for succeeding in higher education, these skills are:

· Networking
· The importance of honesty
· Communicating responsibly
· Handling negative criticism
· Time management

These curriculums are designed for students by students with direction from leading educational scholars from Harvard Ed School and experienced teachers, and it will prove to be an indispensable contribution to your students’ success!
Secondly, we match your students with top university scholars from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Rice, and the University of Texas. We do this through a state of the art interactive platform that is available across devices. Our tutors are carefully screened and trained and are not so far removed from the experience of middle and high school themselves. This creates a dynamic relationship where our tutors relate better to students and are able to become both academic mentors and college advisors. They have all already navigated both high school and the college application process with great success and they are available 24/7 to help your students to do the same and to offer support when it is needed most. 

As an advisor to your students I know how invested you are in their academic achievement and successful college admissions.  Our scholars are trained test prep tutors and have valuable insight into navigating the college application process that will help to make your students’ dreams a reality!  We already have 90,000 students in the Houston Independent School District, all of New Mexico, and all of LA unified schools, and many other school districts spread across the United States. We are also working with partnering with the University of Arkansas and we have already partnered with West Point US Military Academy! We have researched your school in particular and feel as though it would be a perfect fit for our program. We would also like to reach out to your school to not only aid your students, but to help us reach out to all schools in Ohio and get them on board as we have with other areas.

Check out our website at studentsofstrength.com to learn more about our partners, sponsors, and all of our philanthropic services we offer! Let’s partner together to promote Ohio's students’ academic achievement. Contact me with your questions at the e-mail or number listed below. I look forward to working with you!

Thank you,
 Ruby Rodriguez
